# pollaczek-data
Source files for Clara Katharina Pollaczek – Arthur Schnitzler und ich. In Development

The data presented here is taken from the Transkribus-Collection 1233893. 

The Transkribus-export is exported into the folder /trans-out and processed with the xslts in page2main. The resulting xml-files are stored in editions. 

So basically for the text of the pages only Transkribus is the place to make changes

The folder indices will – at some point – include a file listing the type and the dates of individual pages.
